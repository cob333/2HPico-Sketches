# Sketches for the 2HPico-Eurorack-Module-Hardware

Some sample sketches that run on the 2HPico eurorack module

You must have Arduino 2.xx installed with the Pico board support package https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico

Select board type as Raspberry Pi Pico or Raspberry Pico Pico 2 depending on what board you used when building the module. Some sketches require overclocking - check the readme files.

Dependencies:

2HPico library included in this repository - install it in your Arduino/Libraries directory

Adafruit Neopixel library

Some sketches use my fork of ElectroSmith's DaisySP library https://github.com/rheslip/DaisySP_Teensy
